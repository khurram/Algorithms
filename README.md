Algorithms
==========

This project contains basic implementations of various search, search sort, and other algorithms found in the Informatics 2B course and/or Introdution to Algorithms (CLRS).

In addition I may include various data structure implementations or implementations of some more advanced algorithms.

This project is for educational use only, with the focus on ensuring I remember the algorithms - none of this is production code.
